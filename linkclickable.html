          HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. <br>
          It is the standard language used to create web pages.<br>
          HTML provides the basic structure of a webpage using various elements.<br> 
          These elements are called tags, and they tell the browser how to display content.  <br>
          Each HTML tag is usually written in angle brackets like &lt;tag&gt;.  <br>
          Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag.  <br>
          The closing tag includes a forward slash, like &lt;/tag&gt;.  <br>
          For example, a paragraph is written as &lt;p&gt;Your text&lt;/p&gt;.  <br>
          HTML documents start with a &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration.  <br>
          The main structure of an HTML page includes &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt; tags. <br> 
          Inside the &lt;head&gt;, you can add metadata, links to stylesheets, and the page title.  <br>
          The content that appears on the page goes inside the &lt;body&gt; tag.  <br>
          Common tags include &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; for headings and &lt;a&gt; for links. <br> 
          You can insert images using the &lt;img&gt; tag with a `src` attribute.  <br>
          Lists can be created using &lt;ul&gt; for unordered and &lt;ol&gt; for ordered lists.  <br>
          Each list item is wrapped in an &lt;li&gt; tag.  <br>
          You can also create tables using &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;td&gt;, and &lt;th&gt; tags.  <br>
          HTML forms are made with the &lt;form&gt; tag, which can include inputs, checkboxes, and buttons. <br> 
          Comments in HTML are written like &lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;.  <br>
          Whitespace like extra spaces and line breaks are ignored in HTML. <br> 
          To style HTML elements, you can use CSS either inline, in the head, or through an external file. <br>
          HTML5 introduced many new tags like &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;nav&gt; for better structure.  <br>
          HTML is not a programming language—it's a markup language. <br> 
          It focuses on describing the content and structure, not logic.  <br>
          Understanding HTML is the first step toward learning web development. <br> 
          It works hand-in-hand with CSS and JavaScript to build interactive websites. <br>
